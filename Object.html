An object's properties are similar to variables; methods are similar to:
functions


What is the result of the following expression?
var myString = "abcdef";
document.write(myString.length);
6


Complete the expression to create an object constructor, taking into account that "height" and "weight" are properties and "calculate" is a method for the given object:
function mathCalc (height, weight) {
this.height = height;
this.weight = weight;
this.sampleCalc = calculate;
}


function Contact(name, number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.number = number;
    this.print = function (){
        var x = this.name
        var y = this.number 
        console.log(x+": "+y)
    }
 }                 

var a = new Contact("David", 12345);
var b = new Contact("Amy", 987654321)
a.print();
b.print();
